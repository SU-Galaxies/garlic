## Adding modules
### Requirements for adding code to this repo
1. You should be the sole author of the code or have explicit agreement that it can be shared and used without any attribution (see the licence)
2. The code should be documented - That is to say the functions included should have some sort of docstring showing how to use it. (Self evident or self documenting is nice in principle but rarely works in practice.)

### Not requirements but please :)

- Format the code according to nice python standard (PEP8). That makes it easier to read for everyone.
- Long descriptive variable names are better than abbreviations
- Function names like `main` are discouraged since they are pretty common and might overlap with other parts of the code. Have a verb that describes what it does instead :)


## Changing modules
We encourage improvement of the codes here. But please test to make sure that it works before git committing and pushing the code.
